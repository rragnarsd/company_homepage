# Portfolio Site
Project that is part of the Front-End Engineer Career Path - Company home page<br />
For this project there were some requirements that we needed to fulfill. <br />
One of the requirements was to build a company's site, fictional or an existing one and build it with flexbox. <br />
I choose to build a portfolio site instead of a company's site. <br />
The site is built with html and css.

For the navigation bar I used similar code to the youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjrp1FEHnyA
